# Hangman
Play a game of Hangman where instead of one man, a whole planet is on the line. All you need to do in order to bring the Big Bad's mechadroid assembly to a stop is guess his laptop password and pull the digital plug.

You can play the game online by [clicking here](https://repl.it/@error34043/ruby-hangman#main.rb).

If you need some time to think in the middle of your attempt, you can always save the game and get back to it later.
