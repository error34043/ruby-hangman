# Hangman
Play a game of Hangman where instead of one man, a whole planet is on the line. All you need to do in order to bring the Big Bad's mechadroid assembly to a stop is guess his laptop password and pull the digital plug.

If you need some time to think in the middle of your attempt, you can always save the game and get back to it later.
